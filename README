Arpy Framework
==============

Arpy is a bare-bones PHP MVC framework that runs super fast and uses a 
teeny amount of memory.

It doesn't cater for every need but is designed to be quick to run, 
quick to hack, and easy to understand!


Built in functionality
----------------------

Arpy has some built in classes for commonly used functions however only 5 are "required". 
Router, Controller, Config, CCache and View, everything else is pretty much left up to you.

* Auth - key value for basic checks
* CCache - for caching classes you want to have a single instance of quickly
* Config - very simple key value store
* Controller - for controlling app logic
* Cookie - for basic cookie set / get / destroy
* Curl - GET / POST for cURL-ing
* Dater - for translating /displaying dates in different timezones
* EMail - of the PHPMailer variety
* FCache - for caching data to the filesystem (json encoded)
* MCache - for caching data in memory (uses APC as default but could be improved for memcached etc)
* Model - for simple database access, provides a few helper functions
* Mysql_Database - slight abstraction / functions for use by Model
* Router - for routing http requests (requires apache & mod_rewrite)
* Session - for basic set / get access
* Str - for some string manipulation that isn't built in, truncate etc.
* View - rendering output, also supports templates (with some of HTML5 boilerplate)

The framework is set up with some default views / logic in the controller / model to do 
what I most commonly do. Don't like it / want it? Change it!


### Requirements

Again, this isn't built to work for every possible scenario, just what I use most commonly

* Linux
* PHP 5.3 and above
* Apache 2 with mod_rewrite

Optionally it can also make use of..

* MySQL
* PHP APC extension
* cURL


### Who uses it?
